          It all started in the dawn of the new millenia. As the great, incessant wave of Information Technology (IT)
          started to take over our lives, it became inevitable that education, as a vital part of civilisation, adopted
          IT.

          From the adoption, came the need to have an organization to provide IT services to the NUS community. From the
          need, came the birth of us, the <strong> NUS Studentsâ€™ Union Committee for Information Technology (NUSSU commIT)</strong>.

          Today, apart from providing IT services at our <Link className={styles.Links}
            to="/computer-centres" 
            style={{color: 'darkblue', textDecoration: 'underline'}}>two centres at YIH and AS8</Link>, we provide plenty of <Link

          necessary to excel and differentiate themselves in their future careers.
